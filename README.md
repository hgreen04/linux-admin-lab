# Linux Administration & Cloud Operations Lab


Production-style Linux system administration and AWS infrastructure practice.

---

## Overview

## Real-World Simulation

This lab simulates production-style system administration tasks including:

- Provisioning and managing Linux servers
- Implementing secure SSH configurations
- Configuring user access controls (least privilege)
- Managing system services and logs
- Troubleshooting CPU, memory, and network issues
- Deploying AWS EC2 instances within custom VPC environments

The goal is to mirror real-world infrastructure support and DevOps environments.

## Lab Objectives

- User and group management
- File permissions and ACL configuration
- Package installation and repository management
- Service management (systemctl)
- Log analysis and troubleshooting
- Network configuration and diagnostics
- SSH hardening
- Basic firewall configuration
- AWS EC2 deployment and secure access

---

## Completed Labs

### Lab 1 – User & Permission Management
- Created users and groups
- Configured sudo access
- Set directory permissions using chmod
- Applied ACLs using setfacl
- Verified access control with getfacl

### Lab 2 – Service Management
- Installed and enabled nginx
- Configured systemd service behavior
- Analyzed logs using journalctl
- Tested service failure recovery

### Lab 3 – AWS EC2 Deployment
- Launched EC2 instance
- Configured SSH key authentication
- Hardened SSH settings
- Configured basic firewall rules

## DevOps Progression Plan

Planned next phases of this lab:

- Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Provision infrastructure using Terraform
- Automate system configuration using Bash scripts
- Integrate monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and Grafana
- Containerize applications using Docker

The objective is to transition from system administration tasks into full DevOps workflow automation.




## Current Focus

Strengthening troubleshooting skills and building repeatable infrastructure labs to prepare for full-time Linux / Infrastructure roles.
